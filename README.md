## Description

I'm taking the original `.png` files from [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com/) and converting them to individual GIMP patterns. You can download them all as a single ~15MiB Photoshop pattern file [here](http://subtlepatterns.com/patterns/SubtlePatterns.pat.zip).

## Authors

All authors are credited on the orginal website: <http://subtlepatterns.com/>
The individual GIMP pattern files were created by [Daniel Bolton](https://github.com/dbb) and are distributed under the same license as the works from which they are derived.

## License

From the website: "Subtle Patterns is a collection of 88 high quality design patterns for
you to use freely. New patterns added weekly. A project by [Atle Mo](http://www.atlemo.com/)."

## Donations
