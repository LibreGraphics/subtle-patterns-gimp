## Description

The goal of this project is to take the original patterns from [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com/) and convert them to individual GIMP patterns (`.pat` files) for use with the [GNU Image Manipulation Program](http://http://www.gimp.org/), a free and open-source raster graphics editor. 

Note that the color-indexed originals have been converted to RGB.
